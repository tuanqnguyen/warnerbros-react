Notes

This React exercises was created using the following command:
npx create-react-app react_exercise

The countries are populated using this:

The states are populated using this:

The form UI components use this npm package:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-ui-react
https://semantic-ui.com/introduction/getting-started.html

Due to the large size of the npm packages in the "node_modules" folder, it has not been included in the project.

If you run "npx create-react-app react_exercise" then the packages will be installed.

I attached a screenshot of what the form looks like:
